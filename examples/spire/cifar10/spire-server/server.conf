# This Spire server configuration file can be used to configure ports, trust domain, 
# federation, timeout, log directory etc,. 

# The 8081 is the default spire server port used inside container and user can publish
# on their desired port in the host to access spire service. In this example we have used
# port 30307 to publish 8081 on the respective hosts.

# The 8443 is the default spire federation port used inside container and user can publish
# on their desired port in the host to access spire federative service. In this example we 
# have published the same 8443 port on the respective hosts as it is not generally used.

# If user wants to change any of these ports to number other than defined here, then the 
# corresponding run commands of spire agent and server needs change in the run-on-host scripts.

# All time-to-live(ttl) timeouts are kept minimal for this example because this cifar example
# will not take more than an hour even on the basic configuration. No support for certificate 
# rotation, We simply take the first SVID and trust bundle that we get, write them to files, 
# and stop monitoring. So it is wise to take higher values of ttl for longer running projects.
