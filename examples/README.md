## Swarm Learning Examples

Several examples of using Swarm Learning are provided with the package. 

They use different models, data, ML platforms, and Swarm cluster configurations. All examples require valid X.509 certificates to be used by different Swarm Learning components. A certificate generation utility (gen-cert) is provided to enable users to run the examples quickly.

<blockquote>
NOTE:HPE recommends that users must use their own certificates in actual production environment.
