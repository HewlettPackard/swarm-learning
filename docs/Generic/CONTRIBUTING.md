# Contributor guidelines
The best way to directly collaborate with the project contributors is through GitHub: <https://github.com/HewlettPackard/swarm-learning>

* If you want to contribute to our code by either fixing a problem or creating a new feature, please open a GitHub pull request.
* If you want to raise an issue such as a defect, an enhancement request or a general issue, please open a GitHub issue.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a GitHub issue, especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.

Note that all patches from all contributors get reviewed.
After a pull request is made, other contributors will offer feedback. If the patch passes review, a maintainer will accept it with a comment.
When a pull request fails review, the author is expected to update the pull request to address the issue until it passes review and the pull request merges successfully.

At least one review from a maintainer is required for all patches.
