# <a name="GUID-4AB7AD75-8467-4F3F-9392-23C694131D4F"/> Swarm Learning Command Interface

Swarm Learning Command Line Interface \(SWCI\) is the command interface tool to the Swarm Learning framework. It is used to view the status, control, and manage the Swarm Learning framework. SWCI manages the Swarm Learning framework using contexts and contracts. For more information on how to start the SWCI tool, see [Starting SWCI](/docs/Install/Starting_SWCI_nodes.md).

The user can enter any command from the predefined set of commands in the SWCI prompt. The entered command is parsed, then executed and the output is shown in the command line.

The user can provide an init script file that has SWCI commands to be executed at the start of SWCI. If we provide this option, all the SWCI commands within this script file are processed, before it enters the interactive mode and waits for users commands. Users can simulate a non-interactive SWCI run, by having a bunch of SWCI commands and an SWCI `EXIT` command at the end of this init script file. This could be used for automation.

The subsequent sections provide details about SWCI-related commands, and are also part of the **online help** that is available within the tool.

## <a name="SECTION_ZL5_PFG_HSB"/> SWCI commands related to context

A SWCI tool can control operations on multiple Swarm Learning framework instances. Each instance is encapsulated and represented as a context. At a given time, only one context is active. All SWCI commands work with the current active context (default context) and they do not take context as an explicit argument. Before running any SWCI command, users are required to explicitly create a context \(using the CREATE context command\) and activate it as follows:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| SWCI:13 > CREATE CONTEXT **testContext** WITH IP sn.test.sw.net        |
| API Server is UP!                                                      |
| CONTEXT CREATED : **testContext**                                      |
| SWCI:14 > SWITCH CONTEXT testContext                                   |
| DEFAULT CONTEXT SET TO : testContext                                   |
| SWCI:15 >                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
